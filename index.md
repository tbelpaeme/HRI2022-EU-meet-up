## HRI2022 EU meet-up

As the [ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction 2022](https://humanrobotinteraction.org/2022/), or HRI2022 for short, was forced to move from a in-person conference to a virtual only conference, we decided to offer an opportunity for the HRI community to physically meet in Barcelone on 9 and 10 March 2022.

The meet-up is an academic event offering an in-person experience of the HRI2022 conference. As the HRI conference is forced to be virtual for a third year in a row, we feel that a real-life event is long overdue. Participants will largely travel in from across Europe, but anyone who meets the [travel requirements of Spain](https://www.spth.gob.es/) is welcome.

- Watch a selection of keynotes and oral presentations.
- Meet and network with colleagues from across the region.
- Dive in and out of live sessions at the HRI2022 conference.
- Join global networking events related to HRI2022.
- Discuss research in an informal atmosphere and enjoy offline time with fellow researchers.

Details on the venue are being finalised, but there will be an opportunity to follow the conference on a large screen in comfortable room, with ample opportunity for scientific brainstorms and discussions, and for catching up with former colleagues and fellow researchers - all while respecting COVID-related restrictions.
