## Welcome to the HRI2022 EU meet-up

As the [ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction 2022](https://humanrobotinteraction.org/2022/), or HRI2022 for short, was forced to move from a in-person conference to a virtual only conference, we decided to offer an opportunity for the HRI community to physically meet in Barcelone on 9 and 10 March 2022.

During the meet-up we will watch a selection of HRI presentations, offer the opportunity to network with people present
